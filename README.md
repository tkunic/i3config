# i3config
The i3 config running on my Thinkpad T440s. Should work for most 2014-ish Thinkpads. Remap shortcuts if you don't use Dvorak.

Includes:

- Audio and brightness softkey fixes.
- Battery nagging script (add to crontab as `*/3 *  * * *   /home/user/.i3/battery_nag.sh`).
- Touchpad tweaks.
- Quick script to configure monitors using xrandr.
- Hacky i3status prepender (adds memory information, second battery, and paints hardware info blue).
- i3status TimeWarrior integration script.
- And other minor things...
